## Emulator

The shopping cart app runs on the Nexus 5X API 28 x86(G Play Services), other
emulators display incorrect format.

##

The two menus that could have been implemented were one for larger sized fruits,
but the price would increase. The second would be the grade for each fruit, the 
higher the grade the higher the price.

## Application

The shopping cart app greets user with instructions allows them to choose 
from three fruit, but 10 cards are displayed of the same fruit due to time constraints.
They are also allowed add as many as they want before checking out. A menu can be used
to change the fruit to a bigger size for double the price and allowing the user to return
the fruit to the original size for the original price. After clicking checkout the user 
can choose from three options "express", "regular", "no hurry" as shipping options.In the final 
checkout the inital total, taxes and final total is displayed including the selected shipping 
option added in if any option besides no hurry is selected including a thank you message.
